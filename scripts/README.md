# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for maintaing conda packages.

* `maintain.R` - This is a useful script for detecting changes to CRAN
  R packages when you are only tracking a dozen or so
  packages. Requires you to manually edit the current version of each
  package after you update it.
